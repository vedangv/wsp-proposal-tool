# WSP Proposal Management Tool

## Project Overview

A web-based replacement for the WSP SharePoint Excel spreadsheet used for RFP (Request for Proposal) responses. Built as a GitHub PoC to demonstrate the vision to company leadership.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### WBS is the source of truth
All tabs (Pricing Matrix, Schedule, Deliverables, Drawing List) reference WBS items via `wbs_id`. Never create data in other tabs that duplicates WBS — always reference.

### Proposal is the parent entity
Every table has a `proposal_id` foreign key. Always scope queries to a proposal. Never return cross-proposal data in a single query.

### WebSockets pattern
Each proposal has a WebSocket room keyed by `proposal_id`. On any field edit, broadcast `{ table, row_id, field, value, updated_by }` to all connected clients in that room. Last-write-wins for conflicts.

### Agent API namespace
All agent endpoints live under `/api/agents/`. Agents are async — return a `job_id` immediately, poll `/api/agents/jobs/{job_id}` for status. This pattern must be preserved for all future agents.

### No custom formula engine
Pricing Matrix totals are computed server-side (hours × rate). No client-side formula evaluation. Keep it structured.

## Data Relationships

```
WBS Items (source of truth)
  ├── Pricing Matrix   (wbs_id FK — cost view of WBS)
  ├── Schedule         (wbs_id FK — WBS items promoted with dates)
  ├── Deliverables     (wbs_id FK — outputs of WBS items)
  └── Drawing List     (wbs_id FK + optional deliverable_id FK)

People                 (proposal_id only — no WBS reference)
Scope Sections         (proposal_id only — rich text)
```

## Sprint Plan

| Sprint | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| 1 | Repo setup, Docker Compose, FastAPI + React scaffold, DB migrations, JWT auth, proposal list |
| 2 | Proposal detail shell + tab nav + WBS tab (full CRUD) |
| 3 | Pricing Matrix + People + WBS cross-linking |
| 4 | Schedule tab + Gantt chart + milestones |
| 5 | Deliverables + Drawing List + cross-tab relationships |
| 6 | Real-time WebSockets + presence indicators |
| 7 | CV-fetcher agent demo + polish + README + demo script |

---

## Phase 2 (Post-PoC)

When the PoC is approved for full implementation, these are deferred:
- Azure Container Apps deployment
- Azure Entra ID SSO (replace JWT demo auth)
- Oracle HCM integration (employee data for People tab)
- Full RBAC permissions
- Document assembly agents (SharePoint/OneDrive)
- Email notifications and approval workflows

## Coding Conventions

- **Backend:** Follow FastAPI best practices. One router file per domain. Use SQLAlchemy ORM. Pydantic schemas for all request/response models. Async handlers throughout.
- **Frontend:** Functional components only. Custom hooks for all data fetching and WebSocket logic. TailwindCSS for all styling — no CSS files. Component per proposal tab in `components/tabs/`.
- **Database:** All tables have `id` (UUID), `proposal_id`, `updated_by`, `updated_at`. Use Alembic for all migrations — never edit the DB directly.
- **Naming:** snake_case for Python, camelCase for TypeScript, kebab-case for file names.
